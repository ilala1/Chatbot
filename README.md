# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing all dependancies

Start by 'npm i' in the root to install all the dependencies. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` || `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Script

The script is very basic where the first expected input would include 'Hi/hello/bonjour'. Eg.

    'Hi, My name is ...'.

The next response would be to enter a industry out of the list mentioned. These can be edited in the 'lib > script.js' file.

    'retail'

I've also added a default response for anything entered that isn't included in the script file. Eg.

    'Testing'

This will return you a statement asking if you want to talk to an agent which you can respond;

    'Yes/No'
